I wanted to find out the location coordinates where the underwater picture of myself was taken in 1986 Kauai.

My brother took a picture of me underwater in our condo pool in 1986 while in Kauai near Brennecke's Beach. I wanted to create a program to find the geo coordinates of the pool where the picture was taken!
